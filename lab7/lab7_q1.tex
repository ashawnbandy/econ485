\item Use the results from L1 to answer this question.
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item Assuming you don’t have any violations of OLS, interpret the coefficient on “educ” 
from the regression you ran in L1, part a).
\item What was the result of your test for heteroskedasticity in L1, part a)?
\item What was the result of your test for multicollinearity in L1, part a)?
\item Compare the Adjusted R-squared from your results in L1, part a) and part c). Explain the 
difference and why there is a problem with the model in part c).
\item Assuming you don’t have any violations of OLS, interpret the coefficient on “IQ” from 
the regression you ran in L1, part d). 
\item Explain why you do or do not think IQ is a good proxy for ability.
