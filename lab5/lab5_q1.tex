\item Which of the following factors can cause OLS estimators to be biased? Explain. %TODO
	\begin{enumerate}[a.]
		\item Heteroskedasticity.
		\item Omitting an important variable.
		\item A sample correlation coefficient of 0.95 between two independent variables both included in the model.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Of these only omitted variable bias creates bias in the model.  Heteroskedasticity affects the good-of-fit measurements (those that involve measurements of error, in particular).  Multicollinearity can cloud the interpretation of a single coefficient in a model but does not  have an impact on the interpretation of the model as a whole.  \\
