	\item{d.} Look at your regression results, the test for multicollinearity, and the test for correlation. Is there a problem with multicollinearity in the model? Look at the variables in the model. If you believe there is a problem with multicollinearity, explain why you might have that problem.
	\item{g.} Is multicollinearity a problem for the model in part e. Why do you think this result is different from before?
	\item{p.} Why did you decide to include the variable you chose for your model in part o?
