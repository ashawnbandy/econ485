\item Use your results from L1 for this problem. %TODO
	\begin{enumerate}[a.]		\item Use your results from part j of L1. Calculate the Chi-square statistic for the Breusch-Pagan test. Since this model has 10 explanatory variables, this statistic has 10 degrees of freedom and the critical Chi-Square value is 18.31. Write down the null and alternative hypothesis for the Breusch-Pagan test and whether or not you reject the null (or fail to reject the null) based on your results.
		\item Is your conclusion about heteroscedasticity in part a of this problem the same as what you found using the standard STATA Breusch-Pagan test (L1, part l)? I know the values will be different, but did you come to the same conclusion regarding the errors?		\item Based on your answer to part a of this problem and the results of the STATA Breusch- Pagan and White’s test in L1 (parts l and m), which model (L1 part e or L1 part n) is consistent with your results?		\item Using the best model (you identified in part c) interpret the coefficient on team salary (teamsal).		\item Are there any variables missing from this model that might be biasing the results? Which ones? Explain.
