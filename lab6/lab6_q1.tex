\item Explain (giving one or two reasons) why we might want to transform a variable using log (Note: This is natural log). \\

Although there are no well defined rules for using the log of a variable, we would consider using it when we suspect that the relationship between one or more dependent variables and the independent variables is not strictly linear.  One case that begs for logarithmic linearization are economic growth models such as the Cobb-Douglas production function: $ Q_i = A L^{\beta} K^{\alpha}$.  Whatever the reason, it is important that any variable that is log transformed is only positive as the logarithm of a negative number is undefined. \\
